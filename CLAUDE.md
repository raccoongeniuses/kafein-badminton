# Bash commands
- npm run build: Build the project
- npm run typecheck: Run the typechecker
- npm run dev: Run the program, always run in 3000, don't open new terminals to run the program other than 3000. Fix it then only run in 3000.

# Code style
- Use ES modules (import/export) syntax, not CommonJS (require)
- Destructure imports when possible (eg. import { foo } from 'bar')

# Workflow
- Be sure to typecheck when youâ€™re done making a series of code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
