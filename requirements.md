You are an experienced Full-stack Web Engineer.

I want to create a desktop web and mobile app with Tailwind and Next.js that I have installed (don't install again, just continue editing the current project).

This app will be called Kafein Badminton. 

1. A feature (button) to add badminton players to the list (add names manually), minimum of 4 players to generate match.
2. A feature (button) to generate matches, randomly or manually, for 2 courts. And a queue of 2 courts for the next 4 players (maximum 8 players queued other than the ones playing in live matches, already have versus there).
3. A feature (button) to reset session.
4. A section where we can see live matches (here, admin can input the score, after two teams' score are done scored, move the first queue court to live match and record the history in number 7).
5. A section where players queue.
6. A leaderboard section consists of Total Games, Win, Lose, Different Points written as K/D (Earned and Lost), Stat (active -> playing or inactive -> gone home players).
7. History section to see past matches along with the score (maximum of 25 points).


Make the design to be glassmorphism, mobile-friendly on web and responsive.
