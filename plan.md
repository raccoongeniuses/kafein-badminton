# Kafein Badminton App Development Plan

## Overview
Building a responsive web and mobile app using Next.js and Tailwind CSS with glassmorphism design for managing badminton matches, player queues, and statistics.

## Phase 1: Setup Project Structure and Glassmorphism Design System
- Set up main layout with glassmorphism effects
- Configure Tailwind CSS for glassmorphism (backdrop-blur, semi-transparent)
- Create responsive grid layout for mobile and desktop
- Set up global styles and CSS variables for glassmorphism theme
- Create main page structure with all required sections

## Phase 2: Player Management System
- Create TypeScript interfaces for Player, Match, GameHistory
- Implement player state management with useState
- Build "Add Player" component with name input
- Create player list display with status indicators
- Add validation for minimum 4 players requirement
- Mark players as active/inactive status management

## Phase 3: Match Generation and Queue System
- Implement match generation algorithms (random and manual)
- Create 2-court system with live matches display
- Build queue system for next 4 players (max 8 queued)
- Create match pairing logic for doubles (2v2)
- Build queue management components
- Add visual indicators for court status

## Phase 4: Live Match Management with Score Input
- Create live match score input interface
- Implement score validation (maximum 25 points)
- Build match completion detection logic

- Create history display with past matches and scores
- Add sorting and filtering capabilities
- Implement statistics calculation logic

## Phase 6: Session Reset and Final Polish
- Implement "Reset Session" functionality
- Add localStorage for data persistence
- Optimize mobile responsiveness across all components
- Add smooth transitions and animations
- Final testing and bug fixes
- Performance optimization

## Technical Implementation Details
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with glassmorphism effects
- **Data Structure**: TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints
- **Validation**: Form validation for scores and player names
- **Persistence**: localStorage for session data
